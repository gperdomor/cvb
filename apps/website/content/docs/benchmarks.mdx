## The tests

CVB is designed for optimal performance without sacrificing developer experience. We've conducted rigorous benchmarks to compare CVB against similar libraries

Our benchmarks simulate typical developer workflows with controlled test environments to ensure fair comparisons:

- **Libraries tested:** CVB, CVA, Tailwind Variants
- **Test environment:** Node.js v20.10.0, isolated processes
- **Hardware:** MacBook Pro 2019, 2.3GHz 8-core i9, 16GB 2667 MHz DDR4

{/* - Metrics: Operation time (lower is better), memory usage, bundle size */}
{/* - Test runs: 10,000 operations per test, averaged across 5 runs */}

Each benchmark measures a specific operation that developers commonly perform when using these libraries.

| Library           |   Version    | Minified | Minified + Gzipped |
| ----------------- | :----------: | :------: | :----------------: |
| CVB               | 1.0.0-beta.4 |  2.2kB   |        963B        |
| CVA               | 1.0.0-beta.3 |  2.1kB   |        921B        |
| Tailwind Variants |    1.0.0     |  18.3kB  |       9.2kB        |

<Callout>
  While CVB is slightly larger than CVA in bundle size, this difference reflects CVB's additional features like
  comprehensive slot recipe support. Despite these extra capabilities, CVB maintains its commitment to zero
  dependencies, ensuring a minimal footprint for your applications.

## Summary

CVB consistently performs at or above the level of similar libraries across all benchmarks. Our focus on a lean codebase with zero dependencies has resulted in excellent performance without sacrificing developer experience.

We benchmark against cva and tailwind-variants because they're the most similar libraries, and they've pushed us to improve our performance. Our goal with these benchmarks is to provide transparent performance comparisons for the community.

All benchmark code is available on GitHub so you can verify our results or run the tests yourself.
