Class Variance Builder <span className='text-fd-muted-foreground text-sm'>(or just CVB)</span> is a universal, lightweight and performant styling solution with a focus on component architecture for the modern web.

## Performance

### Near-Zero Runtime

In web applications, performance is a priority. CVB was designed with this principle at its core.

CVB achieves exceptional runtime performance by eliminating unnecessary prop interpolations and style recalculations.

<Callout>`cvb` is a tiny library, weighing in at less than 1KB (minified and gzipped).</Callout>

### Server-Side Rendering

CVB fully supports server-side rendering across all browsers. While CVB's runtime is extremely lightweight, leveraging SSR/SSG environments allows you to eliminate this JavaScript entirely from the client bundle for static components, further optimizing performance and user experience.

## Key Features

### Variants

CVB introduces variants as a first-class citizen in your styling workflow, enabling you to create flexible, type-safe component APIs with minimal boilerplate. The `cvb` function provides a powerful foundation for building dynamic UI components.

### Slots

Slot recipes come in handy when you need to apply style variations to multiple parts of a component. While using `cvb` might be enough for simple cases, slot recipes are a better fit for more complex cases.

The slot recipe function (`svb`) enables you to style multi-part components with cohesive variant control. While standard recipes (`cvb`) handle single-element styling effectively, slot recipes excel at coordinating styles across complex component structures.

### Composition

The CVB's powerful composition model allows you to create a library of specialized recipe fragments that can be combined in different ways, enabling a modular approach to styling that scales with your design system's complexity.

### Overrides

CVB provides flexible style customization through the `class` or `className` props on any component styled with CVB recipes. These props let you add custom styles while preserving the variant system's benefits.

### Utils

CVB prioritizes developer experience with a thoughtfully designed API that makes styling components intuitive and productive.

- The `defineConfig` generate your own version of `cvb`, `svb`, `cx` and `compose` functions based on your preferred configuration
- The `cx` function is a lightweight utility for conditionally combining CSS class names

### Developer Experience

CVB prioritizes developer experience with a thoughtfully designed API that makes styling components intuitive and productive.

With CVB, you'll benefit from:

- **Rich TypeScript Integration**: Enjoy full type safety with autocompletion for variant names and values, preventing invalid combinations and typos
- **Intelligent IntelliSense**: Get real-time feedback on variant compatibility and available options directly in your editor
- **Predictable Composition Model**: Combine multiple recipes with a consistent merging strategy that's easy to reason about
- **Zero Configuration**: Start using CVB immediately with sensible defaults while maintaining the flexibility to customize when needed
- **Framework Agnostic**: Works seamlessly with React, Vue, Svelte or any other framework, providing a consistent styling experience. Create your styles, use it everywhere
- **Zero Dependencies**: Keep your project lean and secure with no external dependencies to manage

This focus on developer experience means less time fighting with your styling system and more time building great user interfaces.
