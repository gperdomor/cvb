## Overview

We have developed a comprehensive test suite to evaluate various performance aspects across similar libraries. These benchmarks provide valuable insights into efficiency and speed.

### Test Environment

All benchmarks were executed using Vitest on the following hardware configuration:

- **Device**: MacBook Pro (2019)
- **Processor**: 2.3 GHz 8-core Intel Core i9
- **Memory**: 16 GB 2667 MHz DDR4

### The Benchmarks

The benchmarks are divided into three primary categories for better understanding and analysis:

- **Variants Benchmarks**: These tests measure the performance of `cvb` function, providing insights into their efficiency and responsiveness.
- **Slot Benchmarks**: These tests focus on slot-related `svb` function, evaluating their behavior under various conditions.
- **Composition Benchmarks**: Concentrated on evaluating related performance of composed recipes.

### Open Source Commitment

In line with CVB's open-source philosophy, our benchmark tests are fully accessible to the community.
