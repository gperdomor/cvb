One of CVB's most powerful features is the ability to merge multiple recipes through the `compose` utility, enabling a modular approach to styling that scales with your design system's complexity

## The Power of Composition

By breaking down your styling into focused, single-purpose recipes, you can:

- **Eliminate redundancy** across your component library
- **Maximize reusability** of styling patterns
- **Organize styles** in a logical, maintainable structure
- **Create consistency** throughout your design system

This composition model is ideal when you have common variant patterns that should be shared across multiple component types.

## Building a Modular Design System

Let's imagine we're building a component library with buttons and badges that share several styling attributes. Instead of duplicating these styles, we'll use composition to create a reusable system.

### Step 1: Create Shared Recipe Fragments

First, we'll extract shared styling concerns into their own standalone recipes:

```ts title="components/shared-recipes.ts"
import { cvb } from 'cvb';

// Shared sizing variants that can be applied to multiple components
export const sizes = cvb({
  base: 'font-semibold py-1 px-3',
  variants: {
    size: {
      sm: 'text-sm leading-5',
      md: 'text-base leading-6',
    },
  },
  defaultVariants: {
    size: 'md',
  },
});

// Shared shadow variants
export const shadows = cvb({
  variants: {
    shadow: {
      none: '',
      sm: 'drop-shadow-sm',
      md: 'drop-shadow-md',
      lg: 'drop-shadow-lg',
    },
  },
  defaultVariants: {
    shadow: 'none',
  },
});
```

### Step 2: Create Component-Specific Base Recipes

```ts title="components/base-recipes.ts"
import { cvb, compose } from 'cvb';
import { sizes, shadows } from './shared-recipes';

// Button-specific styling
export const baseButton = cvb({
  base: 'rounded-md text-white cursor-pointer transition-colors',
  variants: {
    color: {
      green: 'bg-green-600 hover:bg-green-700 active:bg-green-800',
      indigo: 'bg-indigo-600 hover:bg-indigo-700 active:bg-indigo-800',
    },
  },
  defaultVariants: {
    color: 'indigo',
  },
});

// Badge-specific styling
export const baseBadge = cvb({
  base: 'inline-flex items-center rounded-md ring-1 ring-inset',
  variants: {
    color: {
      green: 'bg-green-50 text-green-700 ring-green-600/20',
      indigo: 'bg-indigo-50 text-indigo-700 ring-indigo-700/10',
    },
  },
  defaultVariants: {
    color: 'indigo',
  },
});
```

### Step 3: Compose Final Component Recipes

Now, we can compose these recipes to create our final component styles:

```ts title="components/recipes.ts"
import { compose } from 'cvb';
import { sizes, shadows } from './shared-recipes';
import { baseButton, baseBadge } from './base-recipes';

// Basic compositions
export const button = compose(baseButton, sizes);
export const badge = compose(baseBadge, sizes);

// Extended compositions with shadows
export const buttonWithShadow = compose(button, shadows);
export const badgeWithShadow = compose(badge, shadows);

// Alternative approach - directly compose all three recipes
export const buttonPremium = compose(baseButton, sizes, shadows);
```

## Using Composed Recipes

The resulting composed recipes behave exactly like regular recipes, but with combined variants:

```ts title="components/button.tsx"
import { button, buttonWithShadow } from '../design-system/recipes';

function Button({ shadow, ...props }) {
  // Choose the appropriate recipe based on whether shadow is needed
  const buttonRecipe = shadow ? buttonWithShadow : button;

  return (
    <button
      className={buttonRecipe({
        size: props.size,
        color: props.color,
        shadow: shadow ? 'md' : undefined,
      })}
    >
      {props.children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

  When composing recipes, later recipes can override styles from earlier ones. The order matters - recipes are applied from
  left to right, with each subsequent recipe potentially overriding properties from previous ones.
</Callout>

## Composition Rules and Behavior

The `compose` function follows these rules when merging recipes:

1. **Base Styles:** Base styles from all recipes are combined
2. **Variants:** All unique variant groups are merged together
3. **Default Variants:** Later recipes' defaults override earlier ones
4. **Compound Variants:** All compound variants are preserved

This behavior ensures predictable styling while maximizing flexibility.
